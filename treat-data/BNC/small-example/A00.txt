AIDS Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndromeis a condition caused by a virus called HIV Human Immuno Deficiency Virus
This virus affects the body's defence system so that it cannot fight infection
It is not transmitted from
giving blood/mosquito bites/toilet seats/kissing/from normal day-to-day contact
The medical aspects can be cancerpneumoniasudden blindnessdementiadramatic weight loss or any combination of these
Often infected people are rejected by family and friendsleaving them to face this chronic condition alone
The World Health Organisation projects 40 million infections by the year 2000
We are just at the beginning of the worldwide epidemic and the situation is still very unstable
The major impact is yet to come
Professor Jonathan Mannformer director of the WHO Global AIDS Programme and ACET's International Adviser
Raising money for your favourite charity can be fun
You can do it on your own or you can get together with family and friends
There is no limit to the number of ways to raise money
Whether the final total is £5 or £5,000it is all very much needed
Below I've listed some ideas which many people have already carried out
None of them is new and they are all straightforward
If I can help further please do not hesitate to contact me on 081 840 7879 Peter Fabian Director of Fundraising 
Many people with AIDS have to spend long periods of time in hospital unless there is someone at home who can help and look after them
ACET volunteers work as part of a team and provide help in many different ways to ensure that people don't spend time in hospital unnecessarily
The simple answer is as much or as little as you feel able to give
Many of our existing volunteers have families and jobs and are often very busy
You don't have to make a firm commitment but obviously we like you to give us some idea of your availability
This is so we can respond effectively to the needs of our clients
Yes but you are not expected to be a nurse
You will be asked to complete an application form and subsequently to attend an ACET training course one evening a week for six weeks
The subjects covered will include
Your course leader will be available to help you
You are also asked to keep your church leaders informed of your involvement so that they can ensure you are adequately supported
After every client visit you are asked to call the office so that you can report how the visit went
We also hold regular meetings of volunteers to discuss issues of concern and encourage one another
Volunteers visiting an ACET client have immediate access to professional nursing support through our 24 hour on call facility
I would like to be an ACET volunteer so what do I do now
Telephone or write to Christine Catlin or Janet Sutton and ask for an application form

In the charity's Ealing officesCliffwith BBC newsroom South East television cameras in attendancecut a cake to help celebrate ACET's third birthday during June
After a short interview with the BBCCliff went to meet ACET client Tony Chapman at his hometogether with HIV Community NurseSue Lore
A trip to an ACET AIDS education class at Abbeylands SchoolAddlestone in Surreycompleted Cliff's visit
Cliff saidI am pleased to support ACET in the world they are doing
The care of people in the communitywith are ill with HIV infection and AIDStogether with the education of schoolchildren to help prevent the spread of this terrible disease is becoming more and more urgent
I believe it is especially important that ACET represents the Church working in the front line to provide real and practical support
So often Christians are criticised for not getting involved
Cliff with Dr Patrick DixonDirector of ACET
ACET opened its Glasgow Home Care service in late June after receiving confirmation of a grant from the Greater Glasgow Health Board to fund the work
The Ruchill Hospital Social work team and the AIDS Resource Unit were particularly helpful in identifying the need for this service
Home care CoordinatorMargaret Gilliescurrently has a team of 20 volunteers from a variety of churches providing practical help to a number of clients already referred
Strathclyde Regional Council may provide further funding and consideration is being given to the possible employment of a part-time nurse
Margaret Gillies saysWe are discovering the extent of the need for the kind of help that ACET offers from other support agencies including Scottish AIDS Monitor and Body Positive as well as hospital contacts and local counselling services
Chris Southwickdirector of ACET ScotlandsaidWith the opening of this office in GlasgowACET's volunteer home care is now available to 95% of those infected with the HIV virus in Scotland
Most churches are completely unprepared for the shock of finding an established member of the congregation is infected with HIV or dying with AIDSeven though this is increasingly common
ACET DirectorDr Patrick Dixonrecently told the National Symposium on Teenage Sexuality at Swanwick
The conference was attended by 300 church youth leaders and school workers from across the UK
Dr Dixon saidWith up to 20 years from infection to illnesswe just have to ask how many of our congregation have been added during that time
Three-quarters of the AIDS problem is in London and much of the rest in Scottish cities
Churches in these areas particularly need to be informedinvolved in community care and supporting Christian workers seeking to prevent new HIV infection in schools
The Symposium considered how the Church can communicate more effectively to young people today for the benefit of their safety and emotional health
Many churches are responding
Those involved with ACET are now helping provide home care for one in four of all those dying with AIDS in the UK and up to 4,000 school pupils a month are now receiving education on the subject
Both programmes are the largest of their kind in the country
ACET is currently offering speakers to informmotivatetrain and support
Churches wanting a speaker should contact the West London offices on 081 840 7879
The third annual report for 1990/91subtitled Bringing it Homewas published on 21 June this year
Official figures suggest that ACET provided care at home for up to one in four of all those who died of AIDS in the UK last year
24,000 pupils were also seen by ACET educators
ACET will shortly be opening a new office in the east end of London to serve clients in North and East London
Nurse Kay Hopps will have responsibility for the running of the office
The numbers of menwomen and children covered by home care with 24 hour on call has doubled in a year
ACET South based in Portsmouthwill move into its new accommodation during July
Purchased by the Portsmouth and South East Hampshire Area Health Authoritythe building will be home to two other AIDS charities
The team is caring for growing numbers ill on the South Coastincluding Brighton
The 24-page full colour schools booklet HIV It's Your Choiceis now available to members of the public at a price of 50p each
Last year ACET educators saw 24,500 pupils in face to face presentations
The ACET Conference in May at the Ealing YMCA was well attended by both staff and volunteers from Londonthe South EastNorthern IrelandScotlandRomania and Uganda
UK Director and organiser of the ConferencePeter JohnsonsaidFor manythe day provided a reaffirmation of the vision for ACET and a marvellous sense of unity
It was the first time our national and international network had gathered together in one place and made us all realise just how much the work has grown
Three visitors from FrankfurtGermanyrecently visited ACET's offices before returning home to begin a similar serviceChristian AIDS Help CAH
Interest was expressed in all of the organisational aspects of home care including nursingequipment loans and the volunteer programme

Dear Friend
As the number of people ill with AIDS increases so does the need for volunteers to care for them
Over the last three yearsour volunteers have provided much love and care to many hurt and lonely people
The support our volunteers provide cannot be measured in purely practical terms and their continuing contribution is vital if we are to provide an ongoing service
In recognition of their importance and the need to train more volunteerswe want to develop links with individual churches
To do thiswe would like to recruit people who are willing to be an ACET-link in their church
An ACET-link personpossibly an existing volunteerwould keep their church informed about our work and encourage people to consider becoming volunteershelp with fundraising ideas and circulate newsletters
An ACET-link will play a vital role as our work is growing so rapidly
If you would like to know more about being an ACET-linkplease contact Chris Catlin/Peter Glover on 081 840 7879 or write to ACETPO Box 1323LONDON W5 5TF

Anthony Kasozi's work as ACET's Director in uganda has recently received financial support form Tear Fund which has enabled himtogether with ACET General ManagerMaurice Adamsto identify a number of church-based projects for the coming year
These includepedal cycles for a clinic allowing nurses to get out to outlying villageshealth care kits to help with the care of patients in their own homestraining for different agenciesand a variety of education initiatives
Returning from a visit to Ugandawhere he met with patients in the villages and with other agenciesMaurice Adams saidIt is a beautiful country which is being devastated by a disease which can be stopped
The population in general is very well educated about AIDSsays Anthony Kasozithanks to the commitment of the Ugandan Government who have done well in raising awareness
The need here is to convince people that they must change their behaviour
We are seeking to find out what local people wantbecause they must own the work themselves
In this waywith a little money but much commitmenta great deal can be done

You can be perfectly well with HIV and at other times chronic debility makes it hard to do even the basic things
In the early days the stigma of being HIV positive had driven away about 60% of my circle of friends
Despite the publicity giving the facts surrounding the transmission of the diseaseignorance was such that they became afraid of normal social contact
It soon became clear that I could no longer rely on friends for help with everyday chores like shopping and housework when I needed it
While deciding to stay as independent as possibleI contacted ACET who I knew provided practical care at home
I had previously spent about two years asking local social services and friends for help and not having it happenso my flat had become pretty run down
There was also the question of my own exhaustion
Even a weekly visit by a local authority home help when it was finally arranged was not enough
Help provided by ACET volunteers eventually go the flat ship-shape again and life became easier
Illnessesincluding chronic muscle debilityherpestremors and eye infectionshave come and gone
Recently I have experienced serious and potentially fatal fevers
Basically every day is an effortthat's the realityand there's a great tendency to want life to be as it was
I have far fewer friends and I am partially sightedwhich makes me a lot more vulnerablebut whatever happens physicallyI have always said that it was what happened mentally that mattered
Being aware of the stress and pressure that many people and their families experience when AIDS or HIV is first diagnosedI became involved in counselling
I have also campaigned for the Government to give AIDS greater recognitionnot as a disease affecting specific sectors of the communitybut as a social problem for which there must be adequate welfare provision
Organisations like ACET need this support to enable people like myself to retain maximum control and continue to live at home as independently as we can
I have in recent years edited a self-help journal for people with AIDSwritten for the national press and researched a variety of medical material for television
Without the help of ACET and other direct service organisations and charitiesI would not have been able to continue and maintain my independence
By working co-operativelylong-termwith the people around meI hope to continue for some time yet

Maurice AdamsACET General Managerand Overseas Development WorkerKate Bristowhave recently returned from Romania
Kate has been overseeing an AIDS education course in Constanta together with a local representativeAna Ureche
A similar course held at the beginning of the year in Brasovattended by sixty people including teachersnurses and doctorswas particularly encouraging as much of the material wasin turnpassed on to other colleagues for their use
The success of the initial pilot programme has been recognised by the Ministry of Health and the Institute of Health Education and led to MauriceKate and Ana meeting with Government officials and representatives from UNICEF to establish a long-term training programme in five Romanian regionsstarting in November of this year
The attitude of many Romanian health professionals was summed up recently in the words of one doctor in Constanta who said Health Education is the only vaccinewe have to fight against HIV
Kate Bristow commentedIt is a real privilege for ACET to be asked to work with such people as they look for ways to develop an effective strategy
Professor Jonathan Mannformer director of the WHO Global AIDS Programmehas given his backing to ACET by joining Dr Everett Koop the former US Surgeon Generalas an International Adviser
Speaking recently at the 7th International AIDS Conference in Florence he said
I am delighted to support ACET's developing international AIDS programme
Ten years after the discovery of AIDS we are entering into a new era in the global pandemicwith growing concern about our ability to confront it successfully
New approaches are neededwith close partnerships between local communitiesnon-government agenciesgovernments and international organisations
I believe ACET has an important part to play in this process
He addedWe are just at the beginning of the worldwide epidemic and the situation is still very unstable
The major impact is yet to come
Over the next decade a global approach is going to be essential

MAJOR CHANGES in the pattern of HIV disease occurring in the capital which are not obvious from published statistics
The biggest changes are in the length of time people ill with the disease are now surviving and in the nature of the illnesses themselves
Between 1984 and 1986 those with AIDS died on average some ten months after diagnosis
Between 1987 and 1989howeverthe survival period has already doubled to twenty moths
Patients diagnosed more recently are probably surviving an average of longer than two years
The cause of deathfigures are also changing beyond all recognition
The classical pneumocystis pneumonia used to be the final event in the disease process in almost half 46%of those with AIDS in 1986
While pneumonia is still a common occurrencecurrent preventative measures and improved treatment have reduced the numbers dying as a result to only 3% by 1989
This change has big implications for health planners and for those caring for people with AIDS
With the pneumoniasthe interval between early chest infection and death could be as little as 12 hours in someone outwardly fit and well
Planning was often difficult or impossible and the need for home care was less
The commonest cause of death is now advanced Kaposi's Sarcoma a kind of cancer
Slowly growing internal lesions can produce great difficulties in the lung and the gutcausing shortness of breath and other problems
Internal Kaposi's Sarcoma can be very painful
Over a year or twothereforewe have shifted from a population of recently diagnosed AIDS patientsoften reasonably well but with lives dominated by a threat of pneumoniato a population surviving longer and developing a range of further complex problems of a chronic debilitating nature
As London's largest independent provider of community care for people ill with AIDSstaff at ACET have seen these changes unfold in the home
While numbers of new AIDS cases reported officially each month have remained relatively steadythere has been a big increase in those needing expert medical and nursing advice at home with a 24-hour on call back up
The numbers with pain are also higher
Those at home often need opiates morphine-like medicinesfor painwhile one in five will also need a special battery-operated syringe pumpespecially if they are too weak to swallow
The picture then has changed and we now need to plan for increasing numbers of those with chronic illnesses needing specialist community care not just volunteersalthough volunteers continue to have a vitally important role to play
Until the numbers of deaths each month has risen to equal or exceed the number of new diagnosesthe numbers needing care will continue to rise fasteven if the number of new cases reported in official figures is relatively constant or falling
These factors help explain some of the reasons why the total number of ACET clients covered at any one time by our on call service in London has more than doubled from 70 in April 1990 to over 150 by March 1991and why the nature of the services required has become so much more sophisticated
Professionally-based community care is here to stay and is increasingly neededbacked by access to respite and long stay hospice beds and acute ward facilities
Forward planning and good communication are the two foundation stones that must be in place to guarantee that people ill with HIV have the best choices and continue to enjoy the very best quality of lifewherever they choose to be

Care-link unitsdesigned to provide remote signalling of distress via the telephone systemsare currently on loan with seven clients in London
Designed originally with the needs of the elderly in mindthose ill with HIV/AIDS at home are also finding them enormously valuable
Help can be summoned from ACET or other services merely by pressing a button on a pendant worn around the neck
This can make all the difference to someone who feels unsafe alone at home or to partners or friends
Referrals to ACET for Home Care in the London area have increased in the last six months by 50%
At the present rate of referralnumbers are more than set to double during the year
Around 85% of those cared for in the capital are gay menwith an increasing number of women and children
Referrals of African men and women infected heterosexually abroad are also increasing

The plight of children infected with HIV was recently highlighted by Princess Diana when she presented a report by the National Children's Bureau to a London conference on the impact of AIDS on family life
ACET already has experience in caring for children ill with the diseaseparticularly through its Scottish office
In the experience of ACET staff and volunteerspractical care in the home not only benefits the HIV infected individual but the whole familywhich can often mean three generations
At least 60%of the individuals being cared for by ACET in Tayside also have children themselves
Some of these children are infectedbut those who are not are still affected by HIV
ACET believes that specialist and volunteer home care is a vital factor in helping to keep families together and lessening the trauma involved when family members are diagnosed HIV positive
Portsmouth and South East Hampshire Area Health Authority has recently purchased a building in Portsmouth for the use of AIDS agencies covering the South East Hampshire area
ACET Home Carewhich moves into the building in Julywill share the offices with two other AIDS charitiesP.A.L.S
Portsmouth AIDS Link Supportand the Link Project
The Health Authority has provided funding for the running of ACET's office including volunteer co-ordinatorAnne Hutchins
Hampshire County Council has provided £20,000 to furnish the building
P.A.L.S
provides counselling and general family supportthe Link Project deals with drug-related problems and gives general advicewhile ACET provides practical home care not only to the Portsmouth area but also along the South Coast
TWO AND A HALF years ago I was diagnosed as being HIV positive
It was no particular shock when I found outI had expected the test to be positive

IN JANUARY 1988 a small group of 50 would-be volunteers met in the Ealing YMCA to learn about AIDS
This was the beginning of ACET
Many of the first group completed a training course to provide practical help in the home for a small number of people ill with HIV/AIDS
The first referrals came from EalingActon and surrounding areas
This was coordinated from the living room of a local doctor
The remit of this fledgling group was to provide the highest standards of unconditional care to menwomen and children ill at home with HIV/AIDS
Within a short space of time referrals were regularly coming in
In June 1988 ACET was officially launched as a registered charity
Over the next six months this small group of professionals and volunteers provided practical care for 15 people living in or around the Borough of Ealing
To date ACET has provided professional nursing care or practical help to over 400 individuals across Londonexcluding hardship grants and equipment loans
In Ealing alone we have received over 30 referrals for Home Care
It has always been ACET's policy to work with and complement statutory and other voluntary organizations
In Ealingsocial workersH.E.A.R.S Hounslow & Ealing AIDS Response Serviceand the Ealing Home Support team have made referrals to ACET to provide for needs where a single agency cannot give all of the support required
Likewise ACET has also involved other agencies on behalf of the client
Both the Borough and Health Authority have supported the work of ACET in Ealing by being among the first to provide financial support
ACET is currently working with the Health Authority to develop a service level agreement for 1991/92
Monday 8.55am I arrive at the office for what looks like a quiet day catching up on necessary office work and telephoning some of our low-dependency clients to see how they are
There's a message on the answerphone from Tony's brother
Tony has been unwell over the weekend
One of the nurses rings backdiscusses the situation and says she will ring the hospital and/or his GP to see what can be done
I am asked if I can be on standby if transport is needed
9.32am Diary check a general discussion of appointments and availability for the week follow with Janetour Co-ordinator
This includes nurses and volunteers
At the moment it looks like my usual stint of ironing on Thursday and shopping on Friday are the main fixturesbut anything can happen before then
10.10am Still no decision about Tony
We are now waiting for the specialist to phone back
Meanwhileanother cry for help
Westminster Hospitalsay that Andrewon of their patientsneeds to be admitted but they are unable to find transport as no ambulance is available
No other organisation can help
We agree to help and perhaps I can combine the two visits
11.00am Tony has been given an appointment at the local hospital
I will be able to take him and continue into London to pick up Andrew
At least I'll be able to have lunch first and not be munching my sandwich in a traffic jam
1.04pm Tonyand his Mumare still getting ready to arrive
He is not at all wellvery breathlessand by the time we are in the care he is gasping for air
1.05pm Having left Tony and his Mum at his appointmentI set off in the direction of the A4
2.30pm I arrive at Andrew's house
Although he is suffering from a type of septicaemiahe is clearly having a good spell
We make the most of this and scoot off to the hospital
3.35pm Arrive back at hospital no.1
Tony is to be admitted butwait for itto yet another hospital
If I can't take him he will have a two-hour wait for an ambulance
I've heard of a pub crawlbut a hospital crawl
4.00pm We set off againthis time via Tony's home to collect a variety of possessionsfinally arriving at hospital no.3
4.55pm Tony is ushered into a side ward with three doctors and I stay outside with Mum
The only problem isshe is Ugandan and speaks very little Englishhas no idea how to get home and has no money for transport
I try to explain thatunlike her home countryshe will not be staying in with him
Nobody seems to have explained this to herbut finally she understands
Her daughters have however been contacted so I agree to keep her company until they arrive
5.45pm They finally turn up
As the doctors are still with TonyI explain the position to the daughters and hand Mum over to them
6.30pm Home at last
Of courseI still need to catch up on that necessary office workmaybe tomorrow
