Many people with AIDS have to spend long periods of time in hospital unless there is someone at home who can help and look after them
ACET volunteers work as part of a team and provide help in many different ways to ensure that people don't spend time in hospital unnecessarily
The simple answer is as much or as little as you feel able to give
Many of our existing volunteers have families and jobs and are often very busy
You don't have to make a firm commitment but obviously we like you to give us some idea of your availability
This is so we can respond effectively to the needs of our clients
Yes but you are not expected to be a nurse
You will be asked to complete an application form and subsequently to attend an ACET training course one evening a week for six weeks
The subjects covered will include
Your course leader will be available to help you
You are also asked to keep your church leaders informed of your involvement so that they can ensure you are adequately supported
After every client visit you are asked to call the office so that you can report how the visit went
We also hold regular meetings of volunteers to discuss issues of concern and encourage one another
Volunteers visiting an ACET client have immediate access to professional nursing support through our 24 hour on call facility
I would like to be an ACET volunteer so what do I do now
Telephone or write to Christine Catlin or Janet Sutton and ask for an application form

Cliff saidI am pleased to support ACET in the world they are doing
The care of people in the communitywith are ill with HIV infection and AIDStogether with the education of schoolchildren to help prevent the spread of this terrible disease is becoming more and more urgent
I believe it is especially important that ACET represents the Church working in the front line to provide real and practical support
So often Christians are criticised for not getting involved

ACET opened its Glasgow Home Care service in late June after receiving confirmation of a grant from the Greater Glasgow Health Board to fund the work
The Ruchill Hospital Social work team and the AIDS Resource Unit were particularly helpful in identifying the need for this service
Home care CoordinatorMargaret Gilliescurrently has a team of 20 volunteers from a variety of churches providing practical help to a number of clients already referred
Strathclyde Regional Council may provide further funding and consideration is being given to the possible employment of a part-time nurse
Margaret Gillies saysWe are discovering the extent of the need for the kind of help that ACET offers from other support agencies including Scottish AIDS Monitor and Body Positive as well as hospital contacts and local counselling services
Chris Southwickdirector of ACET ScotlandsaidWith the opening of this office in GlasgowACET's volunteer home care is now available to 95% of those infected with the HIV virus in Scotland
